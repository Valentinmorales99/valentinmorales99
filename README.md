### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Valentin and I am currently a graudate EE student at CSULA. I want to improve my skills on machine learning and AI since I have taken a recent interest in it. I am currently working on web development projects on my free time. My favorite hobbies would include anything that has to do with the Star Wars and playing guitar.
